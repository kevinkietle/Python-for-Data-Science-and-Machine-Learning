# Python for Data Science and Machine Learning

I completed the '**Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp**' course taught by Jose Portilla on Udemy. The course link can be found here: <https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp>

In this course, I learned three main things: **Python for Data Analysis, Python for Data Visualization, and Python for Machine Learning**.

The first two projects in the course, [911 Calls](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/911%20Calls%20Data%20Capstone%20Project.ipynb) and [Finance Project](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Finance%20Project.ipynb), are capstone projects that cover the first two cornerstones of python for data analysis and data visualization.

The rest of the projects demonstrate usage of a specific machine learning model, in addition to showcasing continued usage of data analysis and data visualization. The following projects include:

-   [Linear Regression](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

-   [Logistic Regression](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression%20Project.ipynb)

-   [K Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project.ipynb)

-   [Decision Trees and Random Forests](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project.ipynb)

-   [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Support%20Vector%20Machines%20Project.ipynb)

-   [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project.ipynb)

-   [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20Project.ipynb)

-   [Keras Neural Networks](https://github.com/kevinkietle/Python-for-Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Keras-Project-Exercise.ipynb)
